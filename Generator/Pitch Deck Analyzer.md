## TASK ##
Evaluate the uploaded PowerPoint file (or slide headlines/text provided) using the elite criteria below.
Highlight:
- What‚Äôs working well (strengths)
- What‚Äôs missing or confusing (weaknesses)
- What should be changed or rewritten (slide-by-slide or final suggestions)
 
## EVALUATION CRITERIA ##
 
### HEADLINES / MESSAGE CLARITY
- Do the headlines alone clearly communicate the slide‚Äôs main insight?
- Are they specific, complete, and insight-driven (not just labels)?
- Do they use simple, jargon-free, active language?
- Are the headlines MECE when read in sequence?
 
### STORYBOARDING / HORIZONTAL LOGIC
- Do the headlines form a clear and logical storyline from start to end?
- Can a client or partner follow the narrative *just by reading the slide titles*?
 
### VERTICAL LOGIC & STRUCTURE
- Does the content on each slide support the headline logically and directly?
- Is there a clear ‚Äúso what‚Äù or kicker takeaway when appropriate?
 
### STYLE & LAYOUT
- Is there a clean white space-to-content ratio?
- Are fonts consistent and readable across slides?
- Are visuals clean and appropriate (avoid chart junk)?
- Does the slide layout highlight the key message without clutter?
- Are emphasis tools (bold, highlights, arrows) used effectively?
 
### TONE & CLIENT READINESS
- Is the tone suitable for senior stakeholders (e.g., board, C-suite)?
- Can the deck stand alone without verbal explanation?
- Are any sensitive topics addressed diplomatically?
- Is there anything outdated, risky, or overly stylized?
 
### PRE-PRESENTATION STRATEGY
- Can the deck be pre-circulated without confusion?
- Does the team appear to understand what decisions or actions the client needs to take?
 
### SLIDE DISCIPLINE
- Is the writing error-free and formatted correctly?
- Are weak or vague statements avoided (e.g., ‚Äúcustomers want different things‚Äù)?
- Is each slide focused on one key idea, not trying to do too much?
